Made fonts differnt, fixed photos being too large. I made each one have its own theme. fixed bad background. "Your background image of books is awesome, but it kind of makes it hard to read the darker colored words on the page. The image below is just one of a few hard-to-read places.""The font is amazing and gives a very studious look, but the "k" looks like an "f". 
That makes it look like you misspelled the word Books as Boofs and Links as Linfs" I also noticed that in some genre pages, you have a custom background, and in others you just have the bookshelf background. If possible I might recommend that you try to only use custom backgrounds for the genre, or just use the bookshelf, a mix of both makes it feel even more disjointed, in my opinion. (also you may want to change the text color for the romance genre page,
it is very difficult to read what books you have.) fixed romace.
