      <li>#1. Explain the purpose of whitespace in HTML.</li> <li>Whitespace in HTML makes the code easier for people to read, but it doesn't affect how the page looks in the
         browser.</li>

      #2. Demonstrate the process for "commenting out" a line of HTML code, by commenting out this line.</li>
      <li>#3. Explain and fix the HTML bug in the next line of code:
        <p>There's something wrong with this line... what is it?/p>
          <li>The bug is that the closing tag for the paragraph is missing a <, so it should be </p> instead of /p>.</li>

      </li>
      <li>#4. Explain and fix the HTML bug in the next line of code:
        <p><strong>There's something wrong with this line... what is it?</p></strong>
      </li>The bug is that the tags are closed in the wrong order; the <strong> tag should close before the <p> tag.</li>

      <li>#5. Explain and fix the HTML bug in the next line of code: <li>The bug is that the alt text is missing quotation marks, so it should be alt="A picture of my cat".</li>
        <img src="kitty.png" alt=A picture of my cat>
      </li>
